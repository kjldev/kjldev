title: Postgres-based Event Store

I'm loosely thinking about an Event Store based around Postgres, allowing for rich LINQ-based querying based on aggregate types.

I've got a pluggable one that I've been using for years now, it already supports:

- Azure Storage
  - Azure Table Storage for version, idempotency-tracking, and events,
  - Azure Blobs for snapshots and events greater than 32kb.
- CosmosDB for snapshots
  - This is a companion to storing events in Azure Table Storage.
- MongoDb for events and/ or snapshots
  - For snapshots, it can be used as a companion to storing events in Azure Table Storage.

...but I've been thinking a Postgres-based one using the JSONB column type, with GIN-based indexing...

I've been noodling one the variations above for years (and years, and years). I've had it running in production with multiple terabytes of data without issue during all this time - more thanks to Azure's massive scale.

But having a consistent append-only, transactional mechanism for event storage _and_ rich querying for snapshots has always been a challenge.

...time for a re-think?
