  An Azure DevOps extension to render wiki content using GitHub
  Flavoured Markdown (GFM)...because the Azure DevOps wiki renderer drives me crazy ðŸ¤¬ 
status: in-progress

I've been noodling on this for a few days, and despite how
baffling and disjointed the Azure DevOps extensions documentation is, I think I've got a good start on a workable solution...

## 2025-04-29 ... current situation

I've imported some of the [Purview Telemetry Source Generator](https://github.com/kjldev/purview-telemetry-sourcegenerator) wiki to help with testing...

Here's the current state of the extension:
