title: A replacement to GNU Make with scripting

I <span class='text-xl'>‚ù§Ô∏è</span> being able to simply run `make` from a terminal:

```shell
make build

# or

make test

# ... even
make vs
# üëÜ This is particularly lazy as it just
# loads Visual Studio with the correct solution for me...
# I actually got an alias of 'm' too.
```

I've even got a common Makefile I bring into all my projects to give me some sensible helpers like auto-displaying the available targets etc... you can find that [here](https://gist.github.com/kieronlanning/0bd4dedab604ea401a40452f39033c59).

But... what I'm after is something that can act like `make` does, but has more script-friendliness.

A cross between a task runner and a scripting system.

I've looked at a few JS-based ones which looked good, but nothing really fits the bill...

I wanted something with minimal dependencies - just like `make`, _install it and run_.

The problem with any of the JS ones is that you'll need to make sure you're using `node` or `bun` (or even `deno`), and then you've got to make sure its the right version, with the right dependencies.

I _really_ liked the idea of a TypeScript-based one. TS is simple, its approachable, its got rich frameworks and massive re-use through functions in the _'Taskfile'_ etc.

...but, then I'm back to `node` and `bun`.

I contemplated, and even played with, a Go implementation that could parse and execute TypeScript within the app. But as you can imagine that got very complex very quickly.

Now I'm wondering if something like [CS-Script](https://www.cs-script.net/) could fit the bill?

Either host the engine (ideally in AOT build for minimal self-contained executables) or just install the CS-Script app, and use C# as the `Taskfile`...

Some other alternatives to CS-Script include:

- [dotnet-script](https://github.com/dotnet-script/dotnet-script/)
- [csrun](https://github.com/DamianEdwards/csrun/)

> BTW, I have seen [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) but I think there's already too much YAML in the world... and it isn't a nice scripting experience.

## 2025-03-05 ... found Hereby

I've just found [Hereby](https://hereby.js.org/) which looks like a good candidate. It has a few dependencies, but it looks like it could be a good fit... I generally use bun for everything, so that's usually installed anyway.

And it's no drama to install bun in a pipeline, so that satisfies my want for a TypeScript-based task runner...

Looks active on [GitHub](https://github.com/jakebailey/hereby)
and has a good amount of stars and recent commits.
